Syscall list:

0 (print_stack)	Dumps stack to the screen. Arguments: N/A
1 (read)		Reads count bytes to buf from descriptor fd, only stdin (0) works now. Arguments: fd (file descriptor), buf (buffer to read to), count (count of bytes to read)
2 (write)		Writes count bytes from buf to descriptor fd, only stdout (1) works now. Arguments: fd (file descriptor), buf (buffer to read from), count (count of bytes to write)
